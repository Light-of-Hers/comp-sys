## Structure

- Each domain has at least one authoritative DNS. 
- A DNS zone is any distinct, contiguous portion of the domain name space in the Domain Name System (DNS) for which administrative responsibility has been delegated to a single manager.
- Every DNS zone must be assigned a set of authoritative name servers. This set of servers is stored in the parent domain zone with name server (NS) records.
- name server: The Domain Name System is maintained by a distributed database system, which uses the clientâ€“server model. The nodes of this database are the _name servers_. DNS is a hierarchy of name servers.
  - Authoritative name server: only gives answers to DNS queries from data that has been configured by an original source, in contrast to answers obtained via a query to another name server that only maintains a cache of data. 
  - An authoritative name server can either be a primary server (master) or a secondary server (slave). A secondary server for a zone uses an automatic updating mechanism (DNS zone transfers, file transfer protocols, etc.) to maintain an identical copy of the primary server's database for a zone. The primary authoritative name server is identified by start-of-authority (SOA) resource record.

## Resouce Record (RR)

- ANY: all RRs
- A: IP address
- AAAA: IPv6 address
- CNAME: cannonical name for a alias
- MX: mail exchanger
- PTR: used in reverse lookup (`208.80.152.2` -> `2.152.80.208.in-addr.arpa`)
- NS: name server for the name zone
- SOA: the start of the authority for a name zone
- AXFR: used for DNS zone transfer

The SOA record includes the following details (as an example, `ns1.google.com. dns-admin.google.com. 295695647 900 900 1800 60`):

- The primary name server for the domain,
- Email address of the administrator responsible for this zone. 
- A timestamp that changes whenever you update your domain.
- The number of seconds before the zone should be refreshed.
- The number of seconds before a failed refresh should be retried.
- The upper limit in seconds before a zone is considered no longer authoritative.
- The negative result TTL (for example, how long a resolver should consider a negative result for a subdomain to be valid before retrying).

`nslookup` also has an interactive interface:

```
> set type=mx
> google.com
Server:		116.116.116.116
Address:	116.116.116.116#53

Non-authoritative answer:
google.com	mail exchanger = 40 alt3.aspmx.l.google.com.
google.com	mail exchanger = 10 aspmx.l.google.com.
google.com	mail exchanger = 50 alt4.aspmx.l.google.com.
google.com	mail exchanger = 30 alt2.aspmx.l.google.com.
google.com	mail exchanger = 20 alt1.aspmx.l.google.com.
