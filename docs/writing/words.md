## Adjective

- practical and sound measurement methodologies
- dense 5G base stations are deployed
- We use SGS9 because we are not able to **manually switch** between 5G and 4G on SGS10.
- In order to make a fair comparison, we confirm that both devices yield statistically similar PLT when loading **diverse** web pages locally.
- The PR mechanism itself is **detrimental** in the long run, since it keeps the CWND of slow subflow artificially low.
- We integrated the DEMS components into a **holistic system** (§5) and implemented it on commodity mobile devices (§6).
- Since mobile wireless networks, such as 3G, LTE, and WiFi, are typically bandwidth-limited and unreliable **by nature**, streaming video can be subject to frequent periods of **re-buffering**, characterized by **playback interruptions**.
- Our experimental results show that MPTCP-MA can efficiently utilize **an intermittently available path**, with Wifi throughput improvements of up to 72 percent.
- These studies show that most problems are not **artifacts** of specific players but **manifest** across all state-of-art players.
- Regardless of implementation details, **a wide range** of factors **spanning** the server, the network and the client and across the transport and application layers can be customized based on the system designers’ considerations around different tradeoffs to optimize streaming performance. 
- The ABR adaptation logic needs to deal with **time-varying** network conditions and make complex tradeoffs.
- The former provides multi-Gbps rates but is **susceptible** to blockage, whereas the latter is slower but offers reliable connectivity. 
- The use of an HLL that is **conducive** to static analysis made this approach possible.
- We will develop a more **nuanced** view over the course of the rest of this book.

## Nouns

- We also experimentally show that 5G’s high throughput does not always **translate** to better app QoE, whose improvement requires **joint, cross-layer optimizations** from multiple players in the mobile ecosystem. We make the following contributions in this paper.
- **sensitive to blockages** such as a pedestrian or a moving vehicle
- Switching from line-of-sight (LoS) to none-line-of-sight (NLoS) due to blockage may cause significant **data rate drop or even complete blackout** despite the beamforming algorithm that attempts to “recalibrate” the beams by seeking for a reflective NLoS path
- To further ensure that our experiments are not affected by device **artifacts**, we purchase two SGS10 and confirm that they exhibit similar 5G performance. 
- The curvature of the surface is an **artefact** of the wide-angle view. (something observed in a scientific investigation or experiment that is not naturally present but occurs as a result of the preparative or investigative procedure)
- significant performance degradation
- For a single TCP connection, no noticeable throughput drop is observed because of the **bandwidth under-utilization**.
- First, web browsing requires a **synergy between** network transfer and local processing, with the latter oftentimes being the bottleneck in particular for small web pages. 
- The above results highlight the need for **cross-layer efforts** that improve 5G performance under (even low) mobility. 
High-speed railway (HSR) networking asks the new question of how to improve aggregated user experience over **highly intermittent connections**.
- This illustrates that eMPTCP automatically seeks the most energy efficient path usage **without user involvement**.
- MPTCP can improve user experience over WiFi by **associating with multiple APs** simultaneously. By utilizing an MPTCP connection with subflows connected to all available APs, a mobile client can maintain **seamless connectivity** without having to consider a handover.
- Moreover, energy-aware GreenBag can minimize video interruption while consuming 14-25% less energy than the non-energy-aware **counterpart** in real-world experiments.
- Since mobile wireless networks, such as 3G, LTE, and WiFi, are typically bandwidth-limited and unreliable **by nature**, streaming video can be subject to frequent periods of **re-buffering**, characterized by **playback interruptions**.
- For each service, we analyze the first 9 videos on the **landing page** which span different categories. 

## Verb

- To reduce the time to market, carriers may **couple** their 5G core network equipment **with** existing 4G LTE infrastructures in what is known as a Non-Standalone Deployment (NSA). 
- We instead believe that Verizon is imposing per-TCP- connection rate limiting over 5G, whose bandwidth appears to **be fully utilized** when there are more than 8 concurrent connections.
- Such frequent switches make the **throughput highly fluctuating**, ranging from 0 to 954 Mbps.
- How to **strategically select interface(s) among 5G, 4G, and WiFi**? 
- Network conditions vary significantly, and results may **be biased by specific time and location during travel**.
- These alternative algorithms were so far not **extensively tested against** MPTCP’s default scheduler. 
- MPTCP can improve user experience over WiFi by **associating with multiple APs** simultaneously. By utilizing an MPTCP connection with subflows connected to all available APs, a mobile client can maintain **seamless connectivity** without having to consider a handover.
- Regardless of implementation details, **a wide range** of factors **spanning** the server, the network and the client and across the transport and application layers can be customized based on the system designers’ considerations around different tradeoffs to optimize streaming performance. 
- Our analysis suggests that the wireline paths, upper-layer protocols, computing and radio hardware architecture need to co-evolve with 5G to form an ecosystem, in order to fully **unleash its potential**.
- To sum up, the web browsing performance is still **handicapped** by
  the computational efficiency ofmobile devices, which cannot be resolved by 5G. Also, the transient behaviors o fTCP severely **hamper** the 5G network efficiency, especially for short bursty-flows.
