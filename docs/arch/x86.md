```
	; make new call frame
	; (some compilers may produce an 'enter' instruction instead)
	push    ebp       ; save old call frame
	mov     ebp, esp  ; initialize new call frame
	; push call arguments, in reverse
	; (some compilers may subtract the required space from the stack pointer,
	; then write each argument directly, see below.
	; The 'enter' instruction can also do something similar)
	; sub esp, 12      : 'enter' instruction could do this for us
	; mov [ebp-4], 3   : or mov [esp+8], 3
	; mov [ebp-8], 2   : or mov [esp+4], 2
	; mov [ebp-12], 1  : or mov [esp], 1
	push    3
	push    2
	push    1
	call    callee    ; call subroutine 'callee'
	add     eax, 5    ; modify subroutine result
	                  ; (eax is the return value of our callee,
	                  ; so we don't have to move it into a local variable)
	; restore old call frame
	; (some compilers may produce a 'leave' instruction instead)
	; add   esp, 12   ; remove arguments from frame, ebp - esp = 12.
	                  ; compilers will usually produce the following instead,
	                  ; which is just as fast, and, unlike the add instruction,
	                  ; also works for variable length arguments
	                  ; and variable length arrays allocated on the stack.
	mov     esp, ebp  ; most calling conventions dictate ebp be callee-saved,
	                  ; i.e. it's preserved after calling the callee.
	                  ; it therefore still points to the start of our stack frame.
	                  ; we do need to make sure
	                  ; callee doesn't modify (or restores) ebp, though,
	                  ; so we need to make sure
	                  ; it uses a calling convention which does this
	pop     ebp       ; restore old call frame
	ret               ; return
```

## Registers

{% include img.html filename="Screen Shot 2020-03-23 at 7.42.06 PM.png" %}

## MMX

Sometimes, MMX is referred to as _Matrix Math eXtensions_.

The first set of SIMD extensions applied to Intel's 80x86 instruction set, introduced in 1997. 

- With the exception of `emms`, `movd`, and `movq`, all MMX instructions start with the letter 'p'.
- 8 64-bit general purpose registers called `MM0` - `MM7`
- It uses the same register space as the FPU, so one cannot use MMX and floating point operations at the same time. The top 16 bits of each 80-bit FPU register are unused in MMX mode.
- It operates on single 64-bit quantities, 2 32-bit quantities, 4 16-bit quantities, or 8 8-bit quantities all at once

Instructions:

- `emms`: Entering MMX mode is fairly simple; just execute an MMX instruction. Exiting MMX isn't as simple. We use the `emms` instruction to perform this. (Because MMX uses the same register space with FPU, we introduce the concept of MMX mode)
- Movement:
  -  `movd`: leaves the top 32 bits zero
  -  `movq`
- Boolean logic
  - `pxor`, `por`, `pand`, `pandn` (NAND)
  - `psllw/d/q`, `psrlw/d/q`, `psraw/d`
  - `paddb/w/d`, `paddsb` (signed), `paddusb` (saturated at 255),  `sub` is similar
  - `pmullw`, `pmulhw` (stores the upper 16 bits), `pmaddwd` 
- Comparison
- Data Packing
  - `packssdw`: takes a register and another register or memory location, and saturates the 32-bit doublewords into 16-bit words. The doublewords and word results are signed. `packsswb`, `packuswb` (unsigned)

## XMM Registers

Eight 128-bit XMM data registers were introduced into the IA-32 architecture with SSE extensions. They are named `XMM0` to `XMM7` and can be accessed independently from the x87 FPU and MMX registers and the general purpose registers.

## SSE2

It was first introduced by [Intel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel) with the initial version of the [Pentium 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_4) in 2000. It extends the earlier [SSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions) instruction set, and is intended to fully replace [MMX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMX_(instruction_set)). 

Instructions:

- Arithmetic: 
  - `addpd`: adds 2 64-bit doubles
  - `addsd`: adds bottom 64-bit double.
- ...

## AVX

Announced by Intel in March of 2008. Initially, plans are for 16 256-bit registers, but it also extends to 512-bit registers with AVX-512. Whereas SSE registers are called XMM0-XMM7, AVX's registers are called YMM0-YMM15. The XMM registers map to the bottom half of each of the larger YMM registers.

AVX repurposes many [SSE](https://softpixel.com/~cwright/programming/simd/sse3.php) instructions.
