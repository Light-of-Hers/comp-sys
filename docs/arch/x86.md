```
	; make new call frame
	; (some compilers may produce an 'enter' instruction instead)
	push    ebp       ; save old call frame
	mov     ebp, esp  ; initialize new call frame
	; push call arguments, in reverse
	; (some compilers may subtract the required space from the stack pointer,
	; then write each argument directly, see below.
	; The 'enter' instruction can also do something similar)
	; sub esp, 12      : 'enter' instruction could do this for us
	; mov [ebp-4], 3   : or mov [esp+8], 3
	; mov [ebp-8], 2   : or mov [esp+4], 2
	; mov [ebp-12], 1  : or mov [esp], 1
	push    3
	push    2
	push    1
	call    callee    ; call subroutine 'callee'
	add     eax, 5    ; modify subroutine result
	                  ; (eax is the return value of our callee,
	                  ; so we don't have to move it into a local variable)
	; restore old call frame
	; (some compilers may produce a 'leave' instruction instead)
	; add   esp, 12   ; remove arguments from frame, ebp - esp = 12.
	                  ; compilers will usually produce the following instead,
	                  ; which is just as fast, and, unlike the add instruction,
	                  ; also works for variable length arguments
	                  ; and variable length arrays allocated on the stack.
	mov     esp, ebp  ; most calling conventions dictate ebp be callee-saved,
	                  ; i.e. it's preserved after calling the callee.
	                  ; it therefore still points to the start of our stack frame.
	                  ; we do need to make sure
	                  ; callee doesn't modify (or restores) ebp, though,
	                  ; so we need to make sure
	                  ; it uses a calling convention which does this
	pop     ebp       ; restore old call frame
	ret               ; return
